== SEE ALSO
See https://github.com/andrewazores/container-jmx-pubsub-demo and
https://github.com/andrewazores/container-jmx-simple-demo for multi-container
demos of this project.

== REQUIREMENTS
JDK
JMC
Podman/Docker
Gradle

== BUILD
The gradle build expects to be able to find Java Mission Control (JMC) 7
artefacts in the local Maven repository. To ensure these are available, clone
the JMC project at https://hg.openjdk.java.net/jmc/jmc7/ and follow its build
instructions. Run "mvn install" in the jmc project root to install its artefacts
to the local repository. After this is complete, the project in this repository
may be built locally. This can be done with `./gradlew build` or `sh build.sh`.

== RUN
The `run.sh` script can be used to spin up a Docker container of the JMXClient,
running alone but set up so that it is able to introspect itself with JFR. This
can be achieved by doing `sh run.sh` and then typing `connect jmx-client:9091`
into the client shell that appears. Some client shell demo scripts are also
available in the `demos` directory. These can be used with ex.
`sh run.sh "$(more demos/print_help)"`
