The gradle builds expects to be able to find Java Mission Control (JMC) 7
artefacts in the local Maven repository. To ensure these are available, clone
the JMC project at https://hg.openjdk.java.net/jmc/jmc7/ and follow its build
instructions. Run "mvn install" in the jmc project root to install its artefacts
to the local repository. After this is complete, the project in this repository
may be built locally.
